# Architecture

> Workers fork: [WORKERS.md](WORKERS.md) takes precedence for the active workspace.
> Bun/Rspack and legacy development-tool decisions below describe the preserved upstream implementation, not the active Workers path.

Current implementation overview. Accepted future work is in [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md); unresolved
choices are in [OPEN_QUESTIONS.md](OPEN_QUESTIONS.md).

## Runtime topology

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  Source["src/application.tsx"] --> Compiler["Rspack MultiCompiler"]
  Compiler --> BrowserBuild[".ersc/client"]
  Compiler --> ServerBuild[".ersc/server"]

  BrowserBuild --> Browser["Browser runtime<br/>hydration and Navigation API"]
  ServerBuild --> Server["Bun runtime<br/>Effect HTTP and application Layer"]
  Server --> Render["Flight and HTML rendering"]

  Browser -- "document, navigation, Server Function" --> Server
  Render -- "HTML or Flight streams" --> Browser
```

Only protocol values cross runtime boundaries: compiled application exports, asset and reference
metadata, HTTP, HTML, and Flight. Browser code does not import server or build entries. Only the RSC
graph resolves React's `react-server` condition.

## Runtime graphs

```text
packages/effective-rsc/src/
  application/  public authoring factories and application definition
  rsc/          shared Flight contracts
  client/       hydration, navigation, and browser rendering
  server/       HTTP, RSC, SSR, and request lifetimes
  build/        Rspack lifecycle and compiled-server loading
```

Details:

- [Build and runtime graphs](architecture/build.md)
- [Authoring and route model](architecture/authoring.md)
- [Request flows](architecture/request-flows.md)
- [Lifetimes, failures, and protocols](architecture/lifetimes-and-protocols.md)
- [Client-router lifecycle](architecture/client-router.md)

## Boundaries

- `effective-rsc` exposes its authoring API only under the `react-server` condition and throws in
  other runtimes. Types remain unconditional.
- `effective-rsc/server` exposes Bun startup; `effective-rsc/build` exports adapter contract types.
  Other runtime and build modules remain private.
- `src/application.tsx` is the only application filename with framework semantics.
- Generated application artifacts live under `.ersc/` and are consumed only through their generated
  entry points. Build hooks may package their supplied output directories without modifying them;
  the separate `@ersc/vercel` package owns `.vercel/output/`.
- React owns the RSC and Server Function protocols. ERSC adds Effect typing, validation, and
  lifetimes without replacing those transports.
- Applications own React `<ViewTransition>` boundaries and animation policy. ERSC publishes UI in
  React Transitions and supplies router transition types at that publication boundary.
- Effect owns application services, HTTP integration, resource scopes, and interruption.

## Known limitations

- **L003 — Server Function failures:** the handler's typed Effect failure is not represented in the
  client Promise type. Expected failures should be encoded in the output. See
  [OQ-006](OPEN_QUESTIONS.md#oq-006--server-function-failure-channel).
- **L004 — Progressive bound arguments:** binding extra arguments to a Server Function inside a
  Client Component does not progressively enhance without JavaScript because the upstream React
  protocol does not serialize that client-created binding.

## Site, examples, and integration fixture

[`site`](../site) serves installed package docs through ERSC on Vercel. UI dependencies and
deployment-scoped CDN caching are site-owned; native streaming is unchanged. See
[site deployment](../site/README.md#deployment) for cache limits, including late stream errors.

[`examples/hello-world`](../examples/hello-world) is the introductory example for streaming,
hydration, navigation, and Server Functions. It is also the Bun deployment example for Vercel.
[`examples/event-platform`](../examples/event-platform) is the real-world product example.
[`fixtures/framework-e2e`](../fixtures/framework-e2e) is the neutral framework integration fixture;
its routes, data, artificial latency, and UI exist to expose protocol and lifecycle behavior.
